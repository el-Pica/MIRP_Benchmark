# **Download the Dataset**

You can download the full MIRP Benchmark dataset in two ways:  

- <img src="https://huggingface.co/front/assets/huggingface_logo-noborder.svg" alt="Hugging Face" height="20"/> **Hugging Face**: [MIRP_Hugging_Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Wolfda95/MIRP_Your_Other_Left/tree/main)  
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Google_Drive_logo.png" alt="Google Drive" height="20"/> **Google Drive**: [MIRP_Google_Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ILjP6koHgHI7pkXcoce70nNncyz-48KM/view)  

Both options provide a `.zip` file (6.6GB) containing the datasets for all Research Questions (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3) and the Ablation Study (AS). 

<br/>

### **Preview Before Downloading**
If you would like to see what the dataset looks like before downloading it:  <br>
This folder structure here mirrors the structure of the full dataset but contains **only 10 example cases** for each setup.  

<br/>

### ⏭️ **Next Step**
After downloading and extracting the dataset, please:
1. Familiarize yourself with the structure (see below).  
2. Continue to the [`2_inference_code/`](https://github.com/Wolfda95/MIRP_Benchmark/tree/main/2_inference_code) folder to run inference.

# Information about the Dataset: 

Each subfolder for the **Research Questions (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3)** and the **Ablation Study (AS)** contains:  
- **Image folders** with the rotated/flipped CT slices  
- **JSON files** with corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs for each CT slice

<br/>

## Example for each Research Question: 
![My Image](../static/RQs.PNG)
For details, check the paper summary on our [Project Page](https://wolfda95.github.io/your_other_left/).

For RQ1 and for each marker type of RQ2 and RQ3 there are 4,878 image in the Dataset. 
All images are abdominal CT slices extraced from either a volume of the [Amos](https://zenodo.org/records/7155725) dataset or a volume of the [BTCV](https://zenodo.org/records/1169361) dataset.
For each marker type of AS there are 100 images in the Dataset. 


<br/>

## Folder Structure of the MIRP Dataset: 

#### 📁 **RQ1 (Research Question 1)**  
- `images/` – CT slices  
- `qa.json` – Question-answer pairs

#### 📁 **RQ2 (Research Question 2)**  
- `image_dots/` – CT slices with dot markers  
- `image_letters/` – CT slices with letter markers  
- `image_numbers/` – CT slices with number markers  
- `qa_dots.json` – QA pairs with anatomical names for dot markers
- `qa_letters.json` – QA pairs with anatomical names for letter markers  
- `qa_numbers.json` – QA pairs with anatomical names for number markers  

#### 📁 **RQ3 (Research Question 3(2))**  
- `image_dots/` – CT slices with dot markers  
- `image_letters/` – CT slices with letter markers  
- `image_numbers/` – CT slices with number markers  
- `qa_dots.json` – QA pairs without anatomical names for dot markers 
- `qa_letters.json` – QA pairs without anatomical names for letter markers  
- `qa_numbers.json` – QA pairs without anatomical names for number markers  

#### 📁 **AS (Ablation Study)**  
- `image_dots/` – White images with dot markers  
- `image_letters/` – White images with letter markers  
- `image_numbers/` – White images with number markers  
- `qa_dots.json` – QA pairs for dot markers 
- `qa_letters.json` – QA pairs for letter markers

<br/>

**Note:**  
- **RQ3** is the dataset we used for **RQ3(2)**.  
- For **RQ3(1)**, we use the **same data as RQ1** — only the evaluation method later differs (answers are later checked for standard anatomy correctness instead of image orientation correctness).

## Anatomic Structures that we use in MIRP: 
We extracted the anatomical structures that the questions refer to using the Totalsegmentatior: https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator

The correct answers to the relative positioning questions are obtained by comparing the centers of mass of the two structures being evaluated.

- `slice_index`: Slice number within the CT volume.
- `classes_count`: Number of anatomical structures segmented by TotalSegmentator that are visible in the slice.
- `multiple_components_same_label`: Whether there are multiple disconnected components of the same anatomical structure in the slice. (We only asked questions about structures that appear once per slice.)
- `question_answer`

  - `question`: The question presented to the model.
  - `answer`: The correct answer (0 = no, 1 = yes).
- `rotate_flip_short`: Information on how the image is roated and flipped (A: Flip: A1 0°, A2: 90°, A3: 180°, A4 270° || B: Not Flipped: B1 0°, B2: 90°, B3: 180°, B4 270°) [Missing in 146 images with size H=W=768 instead of H=W=512]

# Fixed Prompt: 
The json files contain the questions that we pass to the model. 

In addition to the question, we add a fixed text prompt: 

#### RQ1, RQ2, RQ3: 
```
"The image is a 2D axial slice of an abdominal CT scan with soft tissue windowing. "
"Answer strictly with '1' for Yes or '0' for No. No explanations, no additional text. "
"Your output must contain exactly one character: '1' or '0'."
"Ignore anatomical correctness; focus solely on what the image shows.\n"
"Example:\n"
"Q: "Is the aorta above the spleen?" A: 1\n"
"Now answer the real question:\n\n"
f"Q: {question_from_json}"
```
#### AS: 
```
"Answer strictly with '1' for Yes or '0' for No. No explanations, no additional text. "
"Your output must contain exactly one character: '1' or '0'."
"Focus solely on what the image shows.\n"
"Example:\n"
"Q: "Is the red dot above the blue dot" A: 1\n"
"Now answer the real question:\n\n"
f"Q: {question_from_json}"
```
The example questions in the fixed prompt are chosen to match the question in the task. <br> 
For example, RQ2 with dot marks: <em>"Is the aorta (red) above the spleen (blue)?</em>  

The [`2_inference_code/`](2_inference_code) already contains those fixed prompts.
